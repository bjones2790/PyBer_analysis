# Project Overview

The purpose of this analysis was to identify ride-sharing trends in urban, suburban, and rural locations. This analysis compared weekly fares accumulated within each city type and presents the data in a line graph to help visually display trends over a 4-month period in 2019.

# Results

Ride-sharing data trends from 2019 revealed that urban areas were overall more productive in terms of overall use and revenue received. Of the $63,538 in total fares generated, Urban areas accounted for nearly 63% of the total revenue. This perhaps could be attributed to the traditionally more densely populated areas associated with Urban city types as compared to the other locations. This trend was consistent over the 4-month sample period between January and April 2019, as seen in the chart below.

The data also revealed that average fares per driver were lower in Urban areas compared to Suburban and Rural areas. This indicates that drivers make less per trip in Urban areas, potentially due to the more dense nature and the likelihood for shorter ride trips compared to less dense areas. Drivers were also more likely to operate in Urban areas as the table below indicates. Nearly 70% of total rides and 80% of total drivers operated in Urban areas within 2019, again indicating a potential correlation between population density and demand.

# Summary

To address disparities among the city types, I recommend the following:

1) Determine average ride-share trip lengths for each city type to identify how this impacts the overall cost per mile in Urban, Suburban, and Rural areas. If needed, the cost per mile for Urban areas could be increased to generate more revenue due to the greater level of demand

2) Incentivize drivers to travel to suburban and rural areas to help increase supply. This could help entice more individuals to 
use ride-share services in these areas and generate more revenue

3) Identify other yearly trends to see if demand levels are consistent. This could help identify if certain city types see a greater level of demand/revenue during specific events or periods. This could also assist the company in determining surge pricing, and or determining if additional drivers should be deployed to each city type.
